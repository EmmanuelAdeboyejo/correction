<h1>Earth in space</h1>
<p>The third planet from the sun, Earth is the only place in the known universe confirmed to host life. </p><img src="./earth.jpeg" alt="" width="400px"><img src="./file.jpeg" alt="" width="1000px"><p> a radius of 3,959 miles, Earth is the fifth largest planet in our solar system, and it's the only one known for sure to have liquid water on its surface. Earth is also unique in terms of monikers.</p>
<h2>six fact about the earth in space</h2>
<p>Orbit around the Sun: Earth orbits around the Sun in an elliptical path. This orbit takes approximately 365.25 days to complete, which we call a year. Earth's orbit is one of the key factors that determine our seasons.</p>
<p>Rotation on its Axis: Earth also rotates on its axis, which is an imaginary line passing through the North and South Poles. This rotation takes about 24 hours to complete, giving us day and night.

</p>
<p>Position in the Solar System: Earth is the third planet from the Sun, located in the habitable zone where conditions are just right for life as we know it. It's about 93 million miles (150 million kilometers) away from the Sun.

</p>
<p>Galactic Location: In a larger scale, Earth is part of the Milky Way galaxy. The Milky Way is a spiral galaxy, and Earth is situated in one of its spiral arms, known as the Orion Arm.</p>
<p>Motion through the Universe: Earth, along with the entire solar system, is also in motion within the universe. Our solar system orbits around the center of the Milky Way galaxy, and the Milky Way itself moves through space.

</p>
<p>Gravitational Interactions: Earth is influenced by the gravitational pull of other celestial bodies, such as the Moon and other planets. These gravitational interactions can cause phenomena like tides on Earth.</p>


<h1>Earth and Atmostphere</h1>
<p>Earth's atmosphere is composed of about 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, and one percent other gases. These gases are found in atmospheric layers (troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere, thermosphere, and exosphere) defined by unique features such as temperature and pressure.19 Ọkt 2023</p>
 <h2>What is the relationship between the Earth and the atmosphere?</h2>
 <p>The atmosphere protects life on earth by shielding it from incoming ultraviolet (UV) radiation, keeping the planet warm through insulation, and preventing extremes between day and night temperatures. The sun heats layers of the atmosphere causing it to convect driving air movement and weather patterns around the world.</p>

<p>One of the main components of Earth’s interdependent physical systems is the atmosphere. An atmosphere is made of the layers of gases surrounding a planet or other celestial body. Earth’s atmosphere is composed of about 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, and one percent other gases. These gases are found in atmospheric layers (troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere, thermosphere, and exosphere) defined by unique features such as temperature and pressure. The atmosphere protects life on earth by shielding it from incoming ultraviolet (UV) radiation, keeping the planet warm through insulation, and preventing extremes between day and night temperatures.

    <p>Orbital Dynamics: The Earth orbits around the Sun, completing one orbit approximately every 365.25 days. This orbit is not a perfect circle but rather an ellipse, with the Sun at one of the foci. This motion is governed by the gravitational force between the Earth and the Sun, described by Kepler's laws of planetary motion.

        Moon's Orbit around Earth: The Moon orbits around the Earth, completing one orbit approximately every 27.3 days. This orbit is also elliptical, with the Earth at one of the foci. The gravitational interaction between the Earth and the Moon governs this motion, described by Kepler's laws as well.
        
        Phases of the Moon: As the Moon orbits the Earth, the relative positions of the Sun, Earth, and Moon change, causing different portions of the Moon's surface to be illuminated by sunlight. These changing appearances of the Moon, known as lunar phases, include phenomena like the new moon, first quarter, full moon, and last quarter.
        
        Tides: The gravitational pull of the Moon and the Sun affects the Earth's oceans, causing tides. The Moon's gravitational force is stronger on the side of the Earth facing the Moon, pulling water towards it and creating a high tide. At the same time, there is a high tide on the side of the Earth opposite the Moon due to the centrifugal force resulting from the Earth-Moon system's rotation around their common center of mass.
        
        Eclipses: Occasionally, the Earth, Moon, and Sun align in such a way that one body casts a shadow on another, resulting in eclipses. A solar eclipse occurs when the Moon passes between the Earth and the Sun, blocking sunlight from reaching the Earth. A lunar eclipse occurs when the Earth passes between the Sun and the Moon, casting its shadow on the Moon.
        
        Influence on Earth's Environment: The combined effects of the Earth, Moon, and Sun influence various phenomena on Earth, including climate, seasons, and the stability of Earth's axial tilt (which causes variations in daylight and temperature throughout the year).</p>
